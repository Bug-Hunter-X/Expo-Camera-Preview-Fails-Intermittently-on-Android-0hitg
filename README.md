# Expo Camera Preview Issue on Android

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered when using the Expo Camera API on certain Android devices. The camera preview intermittently fails to load, showing a blank screen despite seemingly correct permissions.

## Bug Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Run the app on an Android device (certain devices will reproduce the issue). 
4. Observe that the camera preview may or may not load correctly.

## Potential Causes

* **Device-Specific Issues:** The problem might be related to specific hardware or software configurations on certain Android devices.
* **Expo Camera API Limitations:** A potential limitation in how the Expo Camera API handles various Android versions or camera hardware.
* **Permission Handling (Edge Cases):** While permissions appear granted, there might be underlying edge cases not handled gracefully.

## Solution (bugSolution.js)

The solution involves a combination of approaches to try and mitigate the issue: (see bugSolution.js)

* **Explicit Permission Request:** Ensures permissions are requested with extra clarity and promptness. 
* **Fallback Mechanism:** Provides a user-friendly message if the camera fails to load, preventing a blank screen.
