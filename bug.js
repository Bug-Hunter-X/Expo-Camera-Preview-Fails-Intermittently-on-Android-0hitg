This bug occurs when using the Expo `Camera` API with certain Android devices. The error message is often vague and unhelpful, sometimes mentioning issues with permissions even when permissions are correctly granted. The camera preview either fails to load or displays a blank screen.  This happens inconsistently, working on some devices and failing on others with similar configurations.
